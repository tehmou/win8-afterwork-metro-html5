INTRO
- apps for windows 8 store (recap of previous)
- microsoft is trying to make html5 a serious choice


WHAT IT IS
- essentially win8 app with html5 is a web page without browser controls
- ..with enhancements


WHY HTML5
- everyone "knows" HTML5 is "the thing"
- no, really
    - leverage existing developer resources
    - take advantage of JS libraries
    - recycle *parts* of your code across apps


WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER WRAPPERS
- there are many solutions that do "native wrapping"
    - PhoneGap
    - desktop widgets
    - Nokia WRT used to do it
    - Adobe AIR    
- doing Metro with HTML5 is.. well.. still doing Metro
- it will look like Metro, and it will be tightly integrated to the platform


WINJS - making it look Metro
- UI framework that supports Metro style apps
- provides a box of tools and components to *easily* make Metro
- large and rich.. you will not *want* jQuery or other UI libs
- WinJS is not a hard requirement


WINRT - making it act Metro
